# RNAseq DMRT1 kos

We have RNAseq data for the dmrt1 kos at tadpole stage 50, which is the critical turning point for sexual differntiation.  One idea would be to focus on a subset of sex-related genes - just like we did for the XL dmw knockout study - and compare vectors between wildtype male:female comparisons and knockout male:female comparisons. The prediction is that there would be a substantial difference between these two. I'd expect the vectors to be shorter (lower magnitude; less differentiated) in the M:F knockout comparison compared to the M:F wildtype comparison. As far as the difference between  the directions of each vector goes, I don't have a prediction for this.
