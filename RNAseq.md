# RNAseq DMRT1 kos

We have RNAseq data for the dmrt1 kos at tadpole stage 50, which is the critical turning point for sexual differntiation.  

### Comparing M_wt:F_wt to M_ko:F_ko
One idea would be to focus on a subset of sex-related genes - just like we did for the XL dmw knockout study - and compare vectors between wildtype male:female comparisons and knockout male:female comparisons. The prediction is that there would be a substantial difference between these two. I'd expect the vectors to be shorter (lower magnitude; less differentiated) in the M_ko:F_ko comparison compared to the M_wt:F_wt comparison. As far as the difference between the directions of each vector goes, I'd expect significant differneces between these vectors but with no specific prediction with respect to how each vector is oriented.

### Other possibilities
Could compare M_wt:F_wt to M_wt:M_ko, or F_wt:M_wt to F_wt:F_ko...?
