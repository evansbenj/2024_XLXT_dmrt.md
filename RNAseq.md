# RNAseq DMRT1 kos

We have RNAseq data for the dmrt1 kos at tadpole stage 50, which is the critical turning point for sexual differntiation.  

## Comparing MF wt:wt to MF ko:ko
One idea would be to focus on a subset of sex-related genes - just like we did for the XL dmw knockout study - and compare vectors between wildtype male:female comparisons and knockout male:female comparisons. The prediction is that there would be a substantial difference between these two. I'd expect the vectors to be shorter (lower magnitude; less differentiated) in the MF ko:ko comparison compared to the MF wt:wt comparison. As far as the difference between the directions of each vector goes, I think the same prediction applies
